# EquityGauge
**EquityGauge**: My project to master advanced Python (FastAPI), web development, and CI/CD. It's a financial web app that scrapes and visualizes company P/E ratios. Demonstrates skills in data handling, API design, Pytest, Docker, and GitHub Actions for clean, tested, and deployable code.
